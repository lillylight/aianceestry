This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## What is aiancestry?

aiancestry is an innovative, experimental platform that reimagines ancestry analysis for the modern world. Harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, blockchain, and cutting-edge onchain technologies, aiancestry aims to make discovering your roots more accessible, affordable, and secure than ever before.

Unlike traditional DNA testing services that are often expensive, slow, and limited by geography, aiancestry aspires to democratize ancestry discovery—empowering anyone, anywhere, to explore their heritage using the latest advancements in AI and decentralized technology.

## Vision & Mission

The long-term vision for aiancestry is bold:
- **To provide a reliable, low-cost, and privacy-centric alternative to expensive DNA tests**
- **To make ancestry insights available to people worldwide, regardless of background or location**
- **To leverage blockchain and AI for transparency, security, and continuous improvement**

We believe that with robust training, real-world feedback, and a vibrant community, aiancestry can one day become a trusted tool for personal heritage exploration—removing barriers and opening new doors for millions.

## Experimental Phase & Disclaimer

aiancestry is currently in an **experimental testing phase**. This means:
- The platform is under active development and research.
- Results may be inaccurate, incomplete, or subject to change as the AI is further trained and improved.
- **aiancestry should NOT be used to replace current, medically-approved DNA testing services.**
- All outputs are for informational and experimental purposes only.

We are committed to transparency and ethical development. As we gather more data and feedback, we will continue to refine the AI, improve accuracy, and expand capabilities.

## What We Hope to Solve

- **Cost:** Traditional DNA tests can be prohibitively expensive. aiancestry seeks to offer a much more affordable alternative.
- **Accessibility:** Many people around the world cannot access DNA testing. aiancestry aims to break down these barriers using digital, onchain tools.
- **Speed:** AI-powered analysis can provide insights in minutes, not weeks.
- **Privacy:** By building on the blockchain and using decentralized protocols, users have more control over their data and privacy.

## Technology & Approach

aiancestry is built at the intersection of several advanced technologies:
- **Artificial Intelligence:** Uses OpenAI models for sophisticated, context-aware ancestry analysis.
- **Blockchain:** Built on the Base chain, leveraging OnchainKit for secure, transparent, and verifiable onchain interactions.
- **Onramp & Web3 Tools:** Integrates modern onramp solutions and wallet connectivity for seamless, user-friendly onboarding.
- **Open Source Ethos:** Committed to transparency, community feedback, and continuous improvement.

## Ethical Considerations

- **Transparency:** We are clear about the experimental nature of the project and its current limitations.
- **Data Privacy:** Your data is your own. By leveraging blockchain, we strive to ensure user privacy and data sovereignty.
- **No Medical Claims:** aiancestry is not a medical product and should not be used for health-related decisions.

## The Road Ahead

The journey for aiancestry is just beginning. Our roadmap includes:
- Robust AI training with diverse datasets
- Community-driven feedback and feature requests
- Partnerships with researchers and technologists
- Enhanced privacy and security features
- Ongoing improvements in accuracy, speed, and usability
